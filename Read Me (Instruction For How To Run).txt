1. Begin by Importing the Database: Please start by adding your database from the 'Database project' file. This database should be named 'qa'.

2. Configuration Check: Next, when you access the source code, kindly proceed to the 'application.properties' file. This step is crucial for ensuring that details like the database username, password, and other related settings are correctly set up.

3. Code Verification and Testing with Maven: Finally, using Maven, gently verify the integrity of your source code. This is also a great opportunity to conduct any necessary tests to confirm everything is functioning as expected.
